Steps to create an IntelliJ Project:

1. Create a nuew project in IntelliJ
2. Select the language (Java, Gradle, Maven, etc)
3. Assign the name (This name must be different from the one that will be created in Github)
4. Create a new file README.me to explain better the code

Steps to create a local repository:

1. Type git init in the IntelliJ Terminal
2. Type git add * (This will add all the files created before)
3. Type git commit -m "Initial Commit"
4. Type git branch -M main (This will change the name of the branch. Git creates a Master branch but now, this needs to be changed to Main).
5. Type git status to verify if there is something else we need to add. If that's so, type git add *
6. Type git commit -m "add new file"
7. Type git remote add origin https://github.com/galvisjuanc/SortingMethods.git
8. Type git push -u origin main

Doing the steps mentioned lines above, you will see all you did on IntelliJ in Github.

Remember to use git fetch to download any remote change to your project.
